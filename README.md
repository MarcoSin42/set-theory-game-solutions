# Set Theory Game Solutions

Solutions to [Heinrich-Heine-Universit√§t's Set Theory Game hosted here](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/djvelleman/stg4), a gamified way to learn Microsoft's automated Theorem Prover, [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/).  As far as I know, no other solution sets exist for this online as of July 2nd 2024.

I am posting these publicly since I found the publicly available solutions for the [Natural Number game](https://github.com/adyavanapalli/natural-number-game-solutions) immensely helpful for me learning how to use Lean.  Since there were no publicly available solutions for this game yet, I decided to pay it forward in hopes that someone else may find use for it.
